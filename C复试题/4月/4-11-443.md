# 443. String Compression

Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.

After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.

Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?



> Example 1:
>
> Input:
> ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
>
> Output:
> Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
>
> Explanation:
> "aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
>
>
> Example 2:
>
> Input:
> ["a"]
>
> Output:
> Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]
>
> Explanation:
> Nothing is replaced.
>
>
> Example 3:
>
> Input:
> ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
>
> Output:
> Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
>
> Explanation:
> Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".
> Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.
>
>
> Note:
>
> All characters have an ASCII value in [35, 126].
> 1 <= len(chars) <= 1000.

## SOLUTION 1：双指针

> left指向压缩数组末尾，right指向当前遍历字符，无论怎样每一次right指向新字符，都会让left也指向这个字符，即`chars[left++] = c;`
>
> 如果有多个重复字符，则计算压缩个数，并用位数调整left的位置，再将个数填充进去

```c
int compress(char* chars, int charsSize){
    int left = 0, right = 0;
    while(right < charsSize)
    {
        int t = right;
        char c = chars[right];
        while(right < charsSize && c == chars[right])
            right++;
        int cnt = right - t;
        chars[left++] = c;
        if(cnt > 1)             //当且仅当只有一个字母才会不替代
        {
            int temp = cnt;
            int len = 0;
            while(temp)
            {
                len++;
                temp/=10;
            }
            left += len;
            for(int i = left - 1; cnt!=0 ; i--)
            {
                chars[i] = cnt%10 + '0';
                cnt/=10;
            }
        }
    }
    return left;
}
```

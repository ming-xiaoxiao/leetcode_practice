# 289. Game of Life

According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

> Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
> In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?

## SOLUTION 1：原地更新

> 题目要求原地更新，且要考虑更新结点必须所有同时更新，则这里我使用标记法，若某结点为2则代表他是复活的结点，若某结点是3则代表他是死亡的结点。
>
> 第一次循环进行标记，第二次循环进行重新赋值即可

```c++
#define N 8

int move[N][2] = {{1,0},{0,1},{-1,0},{0,-1},{1,1},{-1,1},{1,-1},{-1,-1}};

int countNeighbors(int **board, int i, int j, int m, int n)	//m行n列
{
	int count = 0;
	for (int k = 0; k < N; ++k)
	{
		int temp_i = i+move[k][0], temp_j = j + move[k][1];
		if(temp_i >= 0 && temp_i < m && temp_j >= 0 && temp_j < n)
		{
			int temp = board[temp_i][temp_j];
			if(temp == 2)
				temp = 0;
			if(temp == 3)
				temp = 1;
			count += temp;
		}
	}
	return count;
}

void gameOfLife(int** board, int boardSize, int* boardColSize){
	//2代表0->1
	//3代表1->0
	for (int i = 0; i < boardSize; ++i)
		for (int j = 0; j < boardColSize[0]; ++j)
			if(board[i][j] == 0)
			{
				int cnt = countNeighbors(board, i, j, boardSize, boardColSize[0]);
				if(cnt == 3)    //复活
					board[i][j] = 2;
			}

			{
				int cnt = countNeighbors(board, i, j, boardSize, boardColSize[0]);
				if(cnt < 2 || cnt > 3)  //die

# 849. Maximize Distance to Closest Person

In a row of seats, 1 represents a person sitting in that seat, and 0 represents that the seat is empty. 

There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.

Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized. 

Return that maximum distance to closest person.



> Example 1:
>
> Input: [1,0,0,0,1,0,1]
> Output: 2
> Explanation: 
> If Alex sits in the second open seat (seats[2]), then the closest person has distance 2.
> If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.
> Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.
> Example 2:
>
> Input: [1,0,0,0]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: 
> If Alex sits in the last seat, the closest person is 3 seats away.
> This is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 3.
> Note:
>
> 1 <= seats.length <= 20000
> seats contains only 0s or 1s, at least one 0, and at least one 1.

## SOLUTION 1：if-else大法

> if else 判断情况：如果只有一个元素和至少两个元素的情况，只有一个则头尾和那个元素做差，否则就依次找最大差

```c
#define max(a,b) ((a)>(b))?(a):(b)
int maxDistToClosest(int* seats, int seatsSize){
    int maxDistance = -1;
    int last = -1;
    int first = -1;
    for(int i = 0;i<seatsSize;i++)
    {
        if(seats[i] == 1)
        {
            if(last == -1)
            {
                last = i;
                first = i;
            }
            else
            {
                maxDistance = max(i-last, maxDistance);
                last = i;
            }
        }
    }
    if(maxDistance == -1)
    {
        return max(last, seatsSize - last - 1);
    }
    maxDistance = max(max(maxDistance/2, first), seatsSize - last - 1);
    return maxDistance;
}

## SOLUTION 2：逆向思维

> 计算从头从尾和中间的连续0的最大个数

```c
#define max(a,b) ((a)>(b))?(a):(b)
int maxDistToClosest(int* seats, int seatsSize){
    int count1 = 0, count2 = 0;
    int i = 0, j = seatsSize - 1;
    while(seats[i] == 0)
    {
        count1++;
        i++;
    }
    while(seats[j] == 0)
    {
        count2++;
        j--;
    }
    int maxMid = 0, count = 0;
    for(int k = i; k<=j; k++)
    {
        if(seats[k] == 0)
            count++;
        else
        {
            maxMid = max(count, maxMid);
            count = 0;
        }
    }
    return max((maxMid + 1)/2, max(count1, count2));
}

```
